freecodecamp project of issuetracker is tested here with Java Selenium


early version, where factory and object mdoels are used and tested, also here parallel testing did not work properly because webdriver objects called are not independent from the test workflow. 

In a later version this issue is solved


The project tested here is available here: https://issue-tracker-mongo.herokuapp.com/
